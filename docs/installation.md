# Installation

***Homebrew*** is the recommended installation method.

## Homebrew

Recommended.

git-random is available on Homebrew. Run

```shell
brew install olets/tap/git-random
```

## With a shell plugin manager

### zsh

zsh users can install git-random with a zsh plugin manager. Each has their own way of doing things. See your package manager's documentation or the [zsh plugin manager plugin installation procedures gist](https://gist.github.com/olets/06009589d7887617e061481e22cf5a4a).

After adding the plugin to the manager, it will be available in all new terminals. To use it in an already-open terminal, restart zsh in that terminal:

```shell
exec zsh
```

### Others

Users of shells **other than zsh** may be able to install git-random as a plugin. Check your plugin manager's documentation for support for installing commands.
