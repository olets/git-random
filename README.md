**git-random**: build random-content Git trees quickly. An aid for learning and experimenting with Git.

Say you want to try some Git commands on this scenario:

```
a < b < c(branch-a)
  \
    d < e(branch-b)
```

Get there with

```shell
git switch -c branch-a
git random 2 # creates commits b and c
git switch -c branch-b @~2
git random 2 # creates commits d and e
```
